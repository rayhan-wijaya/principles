Principles
==========

* You'll never reach maturity, it is a point system that keeps on increasing.
  * Maturity is like calculus, and possibly even other things, cause
    satisfaction, even, Is calculus. When someone gets satisfied, they get the
    initial kickstarter, that triggers a spark in them. If they do that
    continuously in a very consistent and frequent, ....well frequency, they
    eventually get bored. Now why? With consistent and frequent frequency of
    attempting to reach satisfaction, how does someone get bored with that?
    Well if I put it into words, then I lost my train of thought. Somehow, I
    perceived it even clearly when I didn't have those words.
* Switch between relaxed and thinking, at your pace.
    * Relaxed: Playing guitar with merit,
    * Thinking: Thinking critically -> Can cause headaches, very helpful, yes,
      but damaging and mentally straining. Can cause psychopathy.

Principles
==========

* You'll never reach maturity, it is a point system that keeps on increasing.
* Switch between relaxed and thinking, at your pace.
    * Relaxed: Playing guitar with merit,
    * Thinking: Thinking critically -> Can cause headaches, very helpful, yes,
      but damaging and mentally straining. Can cause psychopathy.

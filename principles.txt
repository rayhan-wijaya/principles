Principles
==========

* You'll never reach maturity, it is a point system that keeps on increasing.
  * Maturity is like calculus, and possibly even other things, cause
    satisfaction, even, Is calculus. When someone gets satisfied, they get the
    initial kickstarter, that triggers a spark in them. If they do that
    continuously in a very consistent and frequent, ....well frequency, they
    eventually get bored. Now why? With consistent and frequent frequency of
    attempting to reach satisfaction, how does someone get bored with that?
    Well if I put it into words, then I lost my train of thought. Somehow, I
    perceived it even clearly when I didn't have those words. I didn't do (a)
    good job of perserving then, but I did now. I preserved the fact that I
    didn't do a good job at saving my past intention--also preserving. I
    preserved the fact that I didn't do a good job at preserving. That's why I
    keep thinking recursion happens in my mind, and how, Computer Science is
    like life B) It connects the dots, there's backing behind how computers ARE
    USEFUL TO ME. IF I DIDN'T... i'll calm down, if i didn't do this in Vim, I
    wouldn't be able to write like this with a very honest mind, and a very
    holeless thought process or flow, really, I don't think when I type. Why?
    Bram Moolenar. But why Bram Moolenar? What does he have to do with the fact
    that I can have the ability to not break a thought process, with the
    software he himself created.
  * Anything is like calculus, empathy for shalat, even. And, you don't feel
    empathy when you don't feel that the other person isn't trying hard enough,
    but then you come to realize when you think more.
* Switch between relaxed and thinking, at your pace.
    * Relaxed: Playing guitar with merit,
    * Thinking: Thinking critically -> Can cause headaches, very helpful, yes,
      but damaging and mentally straining. Can cause psychopathy.

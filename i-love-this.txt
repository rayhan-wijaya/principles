I've never really thought to make something like this. I haven't reached a
point of satisfaction of successfully teaching my client and the need to
justify something near and dear to my heart, far beyond than a naive,
incel-driven love relationship can take you. But, there are mishaps that I need
to settle with Nayla, I promise. From observation, the client seems
slow-responding and doesn't have darting eyes on everything in his screen.
(e.g. He felt amazed by my jack-of-all-trades-style knowledge, despite by the
fact that the quality of the knowledge isn't showing, he said "takjub", but I
didn't knew what that word meant. He questioned me, "really?" and so, he
searched what takjub meant. I saw the meaning as a subtitle underneath the
first search suggestion, "amazed", he only realized that when he entered, to
see the full translation page in shown) And I know, I will reach that point
too, I can already feel my typing speed slowing down every so slightly, not
caring about a thing, because all I want to do is think. This comes from the
bottom of my heart.

I want to cry.
